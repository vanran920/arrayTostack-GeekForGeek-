📦 Array to Stack — C++ Implementation
Welcome to Array to Stack, a simple and efficient C++ implementation of a stack using a static array. This project demonstrates basic data structure principles, such as LIFO (Last-In-First-Out), encapsulation, and memory bounds management. Ideal for beginners learning about stacks and C++ OOP!

🚀 Features
Stack operations: push() and pop()

Fixed-size array storage (arr[1000])

Graceful handling of overflow and underflow conditions

Interactive input handling via cin

Stores and prints results using vector<int>

🧠 Implementation Highlights
Class-Based Design: Encapsulates stack logic using a MyStack class.

In-Place Memory Handling: No dynamic allocation required.

Clear Control Flow: Input-driven stack manipulation for easy testing.

📂 Files
File	Description
main.cpp	Contains the implementation and demo loop
✨ Usage
Compile and run using any standard C++ compiler:

bash
g++ -o stack main.cpp
./stack
Input Format:

1 x   # Push x to stack
2     # Pop top element from stack
Example:

1 10
1 20
2
1 30
2
2
Output:

20 30 10
🔍 Why Use This?
Whether you're prepping for technical interviews, brushing up on classic data structures, or building your own library of implementations — this repo gives you a clean, starter-friendly approach to stack design using arrays.
